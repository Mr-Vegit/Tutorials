                <summary>Q: How can I prevent COVID-19 ?</summary>
                <p>
                    A: The best way to prevent COVID-19 is to get vaccinated with an FDA-approved or FDA-authorized
                    COVID-19 vaccine and stay up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines.In addition, the CDC recommends
                    everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.

                <summary>Q: Is hand sanitizer effective against COVID-19 ?</summary>
                <p>
                    A: One of the best ways to prevent the spread of infections and decrease the risk of getting sick is
                    by washing your hands with plain soap and water, advises the CDC. Washing hands often with soap and
                    water for at least 20 seconds is essential, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating;
                    and after coughing, sneezing, or blowing one's nose. If soap and water are not available, CDC
                    recommends consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

                <summary>Q: Is it safe for me to donate blood during the COVID-19 pandemic?</summary>
                <p>
                    A: It is imperative that eligible individuals continue to donate blood and blood components,
                    including source plasma, during the pandemic. If you are healthy and interested in donating blood,
                    the FDA encourages you to contact a local donation center to make an appointment. One way to make a
                    difference during a public health emergency is to donate blood if you are able.

                <summary>Q: Are there drug shortages due to COVID-19?</summary>
                <p>
                    A: The FDA has been closely monitoring the supply chain with the expectation that the COVID-19
                    outbreak would likely impact the medical product supply chain, including potential disruptions to
                    supply or shortages of critical medical products in the U.S.
                    We have been reaching out to manufacturers as part of our approach to identifying potential
                    disruptions or shortages. We will use all available tools to react swiftly and mitigate the impact
                    to U.S. patients and health care professionals when a potential disruption or shortage is
                    identified.

                <summary>Q: Should I get my pet tested for COVID-19?</summary>
                <p>
                    A: Routine testing of pets for COVID-19 is not recommended at this time. There is currently no
                    evidence that pets are a source of COVID-19 infection people in the U.S. Based on the limited
                    information available to date, the risk of pets spreading the virus to people is considered to be
                    low. If your pet is sick, consult your veterinarian.
