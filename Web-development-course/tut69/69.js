//version meaning and usage
// meaning of version = a.b.c(ex) here 1 = major update , b = minor update or some new function and c = soem bug patches
// now lets see with an example
// here I have launched                                            = 1.0.0 (brand new app)
// now I want to remove a bug so I introduced a new version        = 1.0.1 (with removed patch)
// Now I want to introduce a new function in it so the version= 1.1.0 (since there is no bug in this update)
// Now I want to introduce many functions and remove some too = 1.1.0 (since it is a brand new version or totally modified)

// functions defination
// npm init                            = to create a node module inside a folder or project
// npm/node --version                  = to check its version
// npm install name_module             = to download a module
// npm install name_module@a.b.c       = to download a specific version of the module a ,b,c refers to version numbers
// npm install name_module --save-dev  = to download it for the development process
// npm install name_module --global    = to download it globally so that it can be used from anywhere in the computer
// npm uninstall name_module           = to delete a module
// npm view module_name version        = To check the version of the module
// npm install                         = to install the package manager folder and the modules which were present in it
// NOTE= we can also use npm i instead of using the full install word for downloading a module 

// NOTE= we can also use ~ for dependencies to make them install always the latest version of the modules and > for making the devDependencies to make them install the latest module and we use ^for make the dependencies and devDependenciesto make them install the acurate module versions
